//he async and await syntax in JavaScript provides a way to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain
// It builds on top of Promises and allows you to avoid chaining .then() and .catch() methods while still working with asynchronous operations.
// async/await is essentially syntactic sugar on top of Promises. 

//Assignment
//Write code that
//logs hi after 1 second
//logs hello 3 seconds after step 1
//logs hello there 5 seconds after step 2
